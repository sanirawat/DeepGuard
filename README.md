# DeepGuard  
### Guarding Digital Truth Against Deepfakes

DeepGuard is a multimodal deepfake detection system designed to identify manipulated media by analyzing both visual and audio signals.  
It combines computer vision, audio analysis, and intelligent fusion techniques to deliver reliable and scalable deepfake detection.


# About the Project
DeepGuard is a project built to help identify fake or manipulated media such as deepfake images, videos, and audio. With the rise of AI-generated content, it has become harder to tell what is real and what is fake. DeepGuard aims to solve this problem by checking both visual and audio information instead of relying on just one source.

The system works by analyzing faces from images or videos and also studying audio patterns. By combining both of these, DeepGuard can detect inconsistencies that usually appear in fake content, such as unnatural facial movements or mismatched audio.

Unlike many existing solutions that focus only on visuals, this project uses a multimodal approach, which makes detection more reliable and closer to how humans judge authenticity. The system is designed to be simple, efficient, and flexible so it can be improved further in future stages.

DeepGuard can be useful in areas like social media monitoring, fake content detection, digital verification, and online safety. The goal of this project is to create a practical and trustworthy solution that helps protect digital truth.

# Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, creating fake images, videos, and audio has become easier than ever. These deepfakes are increasingly used to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and damage trust in digital content. Most existing detection systems focus on only one type of data, such as images or videos, which makes them unreliable when content is partially altered or manipulated in multiple ways.

There is a need for a more reliable solution that can analyze both visual and audio information together. By combining these modalities, it becomes easier to identify inconsistencies that are difficult to detect using a single source.

DeepGuard aims to solve this problem by providing a multimodal deepfake detection system that analyzes images, videos, and audio together to identify manipulated content accurately and efficiently. The goal is to build a system that is practical, scalable, and capable of supporting real-world digital trust and media verification.

# Core Idea
The core idea of DeepGuard is to detect deepfakes by analyzing both visual and audio information together, instead of relying on just one type of data. Most fake media can trick systems that only look at images or only listen to audio, but inconsistencies often appear when both are examined at the same time.

DeepGuard works by:
- Studying facial features and movements from images or videos
- Analyzing audio patterns such as tone and speech characteristics
- Combining both results to make a final and more reliable decision

By using this multimodal approach, the system can identify subtle mismatches between what is seen and what is heard — a common trait of deepfakes.

The main idea is to build a simple, efficient, and trustworthy system that helps verify digital content and reduce the spread of manipulated media.
